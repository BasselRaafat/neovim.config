		-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
		--
		-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
		--
		-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
		-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
		--
		-- In general, you have a 'server' which is some tool built to understand a particular
		-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
		-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
		-- processes that communicate with some 'client' - in this case, Neovim!
		--
		-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
		--  - Go to definition
		--  - Find references
		--  - Autocompletion
		--  - Symbol Search
		--  - and more!
		--
		-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
		-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
		--
		-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
		-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

		--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
		--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
		--    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
		--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer
		vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("LspAttach", {
			group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("kickstart-lsp-attach", { clear = true }),
			callback = attach.on_attach,
		})

		-- LSP servers and clients are able to communicate to each other what features they support.
		--  By default, Neovim doesn't support everything that is in the LSP specification.
		--  When you add nvim-cmp, luasnip, etc. Neovim now has *more* capabilities.
		--  So, we create new capabilities with nvim cmp, and then broadcast that to the servers.
		capabilities = capabilities.get_capabilities()

		-- Enable the following language servers
		--  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
		--
		--  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
		--  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
		--  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
		--  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
		--  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
		--        For example, to see the options for `lu a_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/
		mason.setup(servers)

		-- Ensure the servers and tools above are installed
		--  To check the current status of installed tools and/or manually install
		--  other tools, you can run
		--    :Mason
		--
		--  You can press `g?` for help in this menu.
		-- You can add other tools here that you want Mason to install
		-- for you, so that they are available from within Neovim.
